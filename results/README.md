# Model and Explanation Results

This directory is intended to store the outputs generated by the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Contents

This folder may contain:
- **SHAP Summary Plots:** Visualizations (e.g., `.png` files) showing global feature importance.
- **LIME Explanations:** Text files (e.g., `.txt`) detailing the explanation for a single prediction.
- **Model Performance Metrics:** Files (e.g., `.txt` or `.json`) summarizing the accuracy, AUC, or other metrics of the trained models.

**Note:** The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent most of these generated files from being committed to the repository. This is a best practice to keep the repository clean and lightweight.
